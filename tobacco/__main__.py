"""Topologically Based Crystal Constructor (ToBaCco).

ToBaCco or Topologically Based Crystal Constructor was developed to rapidly
produce molecular representations of porous crystals as crystallographic
information (.cif) files, which can then be used for molecular simulation or
for materials characterization.

Original version: https://github.com/tobacco-mofs/tobacco_3.0

This is a version of ToBaCco_3.0 intended to be used as a module, with this is
looking to couple some of its functions with other code.
